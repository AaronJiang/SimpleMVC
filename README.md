SimpleMVC
=========

simple mvc framework for php.

Please set allowoverride to 'All' in your apache virtualhost, enable rewirte mode in apache, and make sure .htaccess file is accessable in your site path. 
The virtualhost configuration goes like this:
<VirtualHost *>
    DocumentRoot /path/to/yoursite/public/
    ServerName yousite.com 
</VirtualHost> 
Note public folder is the folder I've built inside this framework
